[rebalance-lnd](https://github.com/C-Otto/rebalance-lnd){:target="_blank"}  (created by C-Otto) is a tool to manage your channel liquidity by doing circular rebalancing; i.e. sending sats out of a channel with too much outbound/local liquidity back to one of your channel with too much inbound/remote liquidity. 
You just pay the routing fees and can set up some maximum fees that you're ok to pay.

### Requirements

* LND (or LND as part of Lightning Terminal/litd)
* Python

---

### Install pip3

pip is not installed by default on Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit), check if it is already installed and install it if needed.

* With user "admin", check if pip3 is already installed with the following command. If you don't get an output with a version number it means you need to install pip3 (otherwise, move to the next section 'Install rebalance-lnd).
  
  ```sh
  $ pip3 --version
  ```

* if you need to install pip3

  ```sh
  $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
  > [...]
  $ pip3 --version
  > pip 20.3.4 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.9)
  ```

---

### Install rebalance-lnd

* We create a "rebalance-lnd" user and we make it part of the "bitcoin" group (to be able to interact with LND)  

  ```sh
  $ sudo adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" rebalance-lnd
  $ sudo adduser rebalance-lnd lnd
  ```
  
* With the "charge-lnd" user, clone the charge-lnd repository, enter the directory and install the program and required packages using `pip3` (do _not_ forget the dot at the end of the pip command!)

  ```sh
  $ sudo su - rebalance-lnd
  $ git clone https://github.com/C-Otto/rebalance-lnd.git
  $ cd rebalance-lnd/
  $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```

* Add the rebalance-lnd binary file location to PATH

  ```sh
  $ echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/home/rebalance-lnd/rebalance-lnd' >> /home/rebalance-lnd/.bashrc
  $ source /home/rebalance-lnd/.bashrc
  `

* Test if the installation was successful by running the program
 
  ```sh
  $ rebalance.py
  > usage: rebalance.py [-h] [--lnddir LNDDIR] [--network NETWORK] [--grpc GRPC]
  > [...]
  ```
  
* We are going to create a simlink to the LND directory. We'll place the link in the home directory of the "charge-lnd" user to match the default LND directory used by rebalance-lnd (~/.lnd) 

  ```sh
  $ ln -s /data/lnd/ /home/rebalance-lnd/.lnd
  $ cd ~/
  ```

### rebalance-lnd in action

To use rebalance-lnd, use the "rebalance-lnd" user.

* To rebalance two channels, use the following command (the channel ID is the short 18 digits channel ID)

 ```sh
  $ rebalance.py --amount AmountInSats --fee-ppm-limit FeeRateInPPM --from NodeAShortChannelID --to NodeBShortChannelID
  > Sending AmountInSats satoshis from channel [...]
  > [...]
  ```
  
* There are many more options available to fine-tuned your rebalancing strategy. Find more information about them in the [README](https://github.com/C-Otto/rebalance-lnd){:target="_blank"} page of C-Otto's repo.
