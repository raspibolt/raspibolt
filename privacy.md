We configure Tor to run your node anonymously.

Running your own Bitcoin and Lightning node at home makes you a direct, sovereign peer on the Bitcoin network.
However, if not configured without privacy in mind, it also tells the world that there is someone with Bitcoin at that address.

True, it's only your IP address that is revealed, but using services like [iplocation.net](https://www.iplocation.net){:target="_blank"}, your physical address can be determined quite accurately.
Especially with Lightning, your IP address would be widely used.
We need to make sure that you keep your privacy.

We'll also make it easy to connect to your node from outside your home network as an added benefit.

## Tor Project

We use Tor, a free software built by the [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org){:target="_blank"}.
It allows you to anonymize internet traffic by routing it through a network of nodes, hiding your location and usage profile.

It is called "Tor" for "The Onion Router": information is routed through many hops and encrypted multiple times.
Each node decrypts only the layer of information addressed to it, learning only the previous and the next hop of the whole route. The data package is peeled like an onion until it reaches the final destination.

---

## Installation

Log in to your RaspiBolt via SSH as user "admin" and install Tor.

  ```sh
  $ sudo apt install tor
  ```

## Configuration

Bitcoin Core will communicate directly with the Tor daemon to route all traffic through the Tor network.
We need to enable Tor to accept instructions through its control port, with the proper authentication.

* Modify the Tor configuration by uncommenting (removing the `#`) or adding the following lines.
  Save and exit

  ```sh
  $ sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
  ```

  ```sh
  # uncomment:
  ControlPort 9051
  CookieAuthentication 1

  # add:
  CookieAuthFileGroupReadable 1
  ```

* Reload Tor configuration to activate the modifications

  ```sh
  $ sudo systemctl reload tor
  ```

Not all network traffic is routed over the Tor network.
But we now have the base to configure sensitive applications to use it.

## SSH remote access through Tor (optional)

If you want to log into your RaspiBolt with SSH when you're away, you can easily do so by adding a Tor hidden service.
This makes "calling home" very easy, without the need to configure anything on your internet router.

### SSH server

* Add the following three lines in the "location-hidden services" section of the `torrc` file.
  Save and exit

  ```sh
  $ sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
  ```

  ```sh
  ############### This section is just for location-hidden services ###

  HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_sshd/
  HiddenServiceVersion 3
  HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22
  ```

* Reload Tor configuration and look up your Tor connection address

  ```sh
  $ sudo systemctl reload tor
  $ sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_sshd/hostname
  > abcdefg..............xyz.onion
  ```

* Save the Tor address in a secure location, e.g., your password manager.

### SSH client

You also need to have Tor installed on your regular computer where you start the SSH connection.
Usage of SSH over Tor differs by client and operating system.

A few examples:

* **Windows**: configure PuTTY as described in this guide [Torifying PuTTY](https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorifyHOWTO/Putty){:target="_blank"} by the Tor Project.

* **MacOS and Linux**: use `torify` or `torsocks`.
  Both work similarly; just use whatever you have available:

  ```sh
  $ torify ssh admin@abcdefg..............xyz.onion
  ```
  ```sh
  $ torsocks ssh admin@abcdefg..............xyz.onion
  ```
