## Requirements

* Bitcoin Core

---

## Introduction

The guide will show you how to:

1. Configure BTC Core allowing Bisq to run its SPV wallet and whitelisting the P2P connection
1. Install Bisq on your personal computer
1. Connect Bisq to your Bitcoin Core own node in your local network or via remote Tor and depending on your OS personal computer
1. Securely set up Bisq

---

## Installation

* Download Bisq on your personal computer using the appropriate binary for your OS: [https://bisq.network/downloads/](https://bisq.network/downloads/){:target="_blank"}

* Verify the downloaded binary following [Bisq guidelines](https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing){:target="_blank"}

* Once you've verified the integrity of the downloaded Bisq binary, install it on your personal computer but do NOT launch Bisq yet!

---

### Configure Firewall

* Configure the firewall to allow incoming requests to Bitcoin Core from the local network.

  ```sh
  $ sudo ufw allow 8333/tcp comment 'allow Bitcoin Core' 
  ```

### Configure Bitcoin Core

For Bisq to connect to your Bitcoin Core node, the bloom filters have to be activated and the P2P connection has to be whitelisted.

* Open `bitcoin.conf` to add `peerbloomfilters=1` under `"# Bitcoin daemon"` to activate bloom filters

  ```sh
  $ sudo nano /data/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
  ```

  ```sh
  # Filters
  peerbloomfilters=1   # for Bisq
  ```

* Add the following line under `"whitelist=download@127.0.0.1       # for Electrs"` line to whitelist our own P2P connection.

  ```sh
  whitelist=bloomfilter@192.168.0.0/16   # for Bisq
  ```

* By default `bind` configuration of Bitcoin Core is `0.0.0.0`. To connect Bisq from your personal computer in your local network, comment or delete `bind=127.0.0.1`. Save and exit.

  ```sh
  #bind=127.0.0.1
  ```

* Restart Bitcoin Core (if you didn't set up automatic LND wallet unlock, remember to unlock it after `bitcoind` restarted).

  ```sh
  $ sudo systemctl restart bitcoind
  ```

* Still with user admin, wait a few minutes until Bitcoin Core starts completely and run the following command and make a copy of the .onion address and port (e.g. here, `123...abc.onion:8333`).

  ```sh
  $ bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo | grep address.*onion
  > "address": "123...abc.onion:8333"
  ```

## Connect Bisq to your own node

For Linux and MacOS, we will start Bisq the first time using the command line to force it to connect to your Bitcoin node only.

On your personal computer where you installed Bisq, depending on your OS

**For Linux:**

* Open a command line terminal, we will start Bisq with two flags that will force it to connect to our own node only. Bisq should connect to your node on startup.

From local network connection, replace `192.168.X.X:8333` with your own node IP address.
  
  ```sh
  $ /opt/bisq/bin/Bisq -btcNodes=192.168.X.X:8333 -useTorForBtc=false
  ```

From remote connection, replace `123...abc.onion:8333` with your own Bitcoin Core .onion address that you obtained above.
  
  ```sh
  $ /opt/bisq/bin/Bisq -btcNodes=123...abc.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true
  ```

* Wait a few minutes until Bisq is up to date with the current state of the blockchain and go back to "Settings" > "Network info" to check that only your own node local IP address or onion address is listed in the first table.

* Check that the "Bitcoin network peers" counter at the bottom right of the window is equal to 1.

**For MacOS:**

* Open a command line terminal, we will start Bisq with two flags that will force it to connect to our own node only.

* From local network connection, replace `192.168.X.X:8333` with your own node IP address.
  
  ```sh
  $ Bisq -btcNodes=192.168.X.X:8333 -useTorForBtc=false
  ```

* From remote connection, replace `123...abc.onion:8333` with your own Bitcoin Core .onion address that you obtained above.
  
  ```sh
  $ Bisq -btcNodes=123...abc.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true
  ```

* Wait a few minutes until Bisq is up to date with the current state of the blockchain and go back to "Settings" > "Network info" to check that only your own node local IP address or onion address is listed in the first table.

* Check that the "Bitcoin network peers" counter at the bottom right of the window is equal to 1.

**For Windows**, Bisq is automatically opened using the GUI, we can't start Bisq the first time using the command line to force it to connect to your Bitcoin node only, so it will connect to several remote Bitcoin nodes via Tor, don't worry, we are going to change fastly this configuration:

* Start Bisq using the GUI icon.

* Click on the "Settings" > "Network info" tab.

* In the "Bitcoin Network" section, click on "Use custom Bitcoin Core nodes".

* In the box just below, paste your node IP address (`192.168.X.X`) or Bitcoin Core node `.onion` address `(e.g: 123...abc.onion:8333)` that you obtained above, depending if you are connecting locally or remotely via Tor.

* Check/uncheck "Use Tor for Bitcoin network" under Settings > Network, depending if you are connecting locally or remotely via Tor.

* Click on any other tab at the top. Bisq will ask you to shutdown the program to make your change effective.

* Click "Shutdown"

* Start Bisq again using the GUI icon.

* Wait a few minutes until Bisq is up to date with the current state of the blockchain and go back to "Settings" > "Network info" to check that only your own node local IP address or onion address is listed in the first table.

* Check that the "Bitcoin network peers" counter at the bottom right of the window is equal to 1.

ðŸ¥³ Congrats! Bisq is now connected to your node.
