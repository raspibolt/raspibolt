# Bitcoin

The base of a sovereign Bitcoin node is a fully validating Bitcoin client.
It will download the whole blockchain and validate every single transaction that ever happened.
After this verification, the client can check the validity of all future transactions.

Your Bitcoin client also acts as a data source for other applications, like the Electrum server (to use with your software and hardware wallets), Blockchain Explorer or Lightning client.
